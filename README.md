# VoidBox.net
A web app that uses Java EE and some very basic rest services. 
This project is not yet complete and I will be re-visting it in the near future.
Some of the functionality works currently but lacks the shopping cart features that
the webapp should provide.This was my first standalone project to put on my portfolio
and no longer showcases many of the skills I have learned since its creation. Expect updates Fall of 2019.
